# Adobe 2D shapes detection 

This Jupyter Notebook showcases Python code that possesses the ability to detect 2D shapes like circles and triangles. The code's magic lies in its computation of centroids, distances, and side lengths, enabling accurate shape identification. We've applied this code to sample images provided by Abode's test cases and included the resulting shape detections in this repository.
